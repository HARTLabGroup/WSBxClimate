## Organization of the project

The project has the following structure:

-   [Code](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/tree/base/Code): All code written for this project

    -   [AspenHabitat-Highlights.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-Highlights.Rmd): An R markdown file that generates a Microsoft Word document wit the project highlights.

    -   [AspenHabitat-Highlights.docx](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-Highlights.docx): A Microsoft Word document wit the project highlights.

    -   [AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd): An R markdown file with most of the R code. This file also generates a Microsoft Word document with the main text of the manuscript.

    -   [AspenHabitat-MainText.docx](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-MainText.docx): A Microsoft Word document with the main text of the manuscript.

    -   [AspenHabitat-Supplement.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-Supplement.Rmd): An R markdown with code for some supplemental analyses.

    -   [AspenHabitat-Supplement.docx](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-Supplement.docx): A Microsoft Word document with supplemental figures and tables.

    -   [GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R): An R file that performs a multi-step procedure that spatially downscales gridded climate data using GIDS (Gradient and Inverse Distance-Squared) of Nalder and Wein (1998) and Flint and Flint (2012). It was lightly modified from code written by Rodman et al. (2020).

    -   [Template.docx](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/Template.docx): A Microsoft Word document used to a style template for generating AspenHabitatModelling.docx

    -   [references.bib](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/references.bib): A BibTeX file containing all information for all references used in the project

-   [Documents](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/tree/base/Documents): All code written for this project

    -   [ODMAP-Table.xlsx](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Documents/ODMAP-Table.xlsx): Documentation of the species distribution modeling methods used herein following standard protocols outlined by Zurell et al.
        (2020)

## Description of Analyses and Data

### Code

Nearly all analyses are can be run from the script [AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd), which references the [GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/GIDS-Downscaling-SJH.R) script. Supplemental analyses are included in the script [AspenHabitat-Supplement.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-Supplement.Rmd). All scripts use relative paths with the .rproj file and the "here" package in R to reference each of the datasets and use them in analyses. To repeat our analyses, this project must be open in R Studio software prior to opening the .rmd document.

### Input data

All input data is publicly available. The main script is structured to download all data from the internet, however we acknowledge that broken URLs are a common issue. Additional users should take note that the code is structured to download data only once. Thus care should be taken when users are interested in replacing input datasets with updated versions. The best approach is to delete the entire directory where the data is stored.

### Output data

Maps of the predictions of current and future aspen habitat suitability generated by running the [AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd](https://github.com/HARTLabGroup/AspenHabitat/blob/base/Code/AspenHabitat-MainText.Rmd) script are also forthcoming on [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t76hdr88v).
