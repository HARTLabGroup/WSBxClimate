## DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

### Dataset structure

This dataset has the following structure

```
|-- README.md           # metadata
|-- 3-Isle-98-pm.rwl    # raw ring width data from the Theree Island Lake Trail
|-- Siteinfo.csv        # information on sites sampled
```

### Relationship between files, if important: 
Siteinfo.csv contains geographic information on the sampling sites. 

## Methods

### Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

### Methods for processing the data: 
Standard methods were used to prepare tree cores (Stokes and Smiley 1968). Tree ring width was then measured to the nearest 0.01 mm along a single path using a Velmex stage equipped with a microscope. 

### Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
To ensure accurate dating, tree cores were visually crossdated and statistically crosssdated using the computer program COFECHA (Cook and Holmes 1984).

### People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: 

Tree coring was performed Thomas T. Veblen, Jason Sibold, and Mauro Gonzalez.
