  abstract = {1 Western spruce budworm Choristoneura occidentalis Free. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) emerge in the spring before budburst and then face a rapidly deteriorating host quality each season. 2 Measures of fitness, survival and fecundity, were made on cohorts of final-instar spruce budworms deployed on host trees at several times during the season in four field locations in coastal and interior British Columbia, Canada. 3 Survival and fecundity were strongly correlated throughout the season and varied as much as four-fold from maxima at mid-season to minima at the end of the season. 4 Fitness values overall were greatest in the coastal compared with interior locations. Among interior locations, fitness was greatest at the highest elevation and least at the lowest elevation. Both cohort and sample-based estimates of survival of wild, final-instar budworms were relatively high in these outbreak populations. 5 The influence of the phenological window and degree of synchrony with the host plant on herbivore abundance often depends on other processes affecting population rates of change.},

  abstract = {Climate change affects the geographic range and outbreak behavior of forest insects. Both the range and dynamics of insect populations are linked to physiological responses to abiotic conditions and trophic interactions via their effects on individual fitness. We develop a process-based simulation model of population fitness for the western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis (Freeman) to examine the effects of temperature on historical range and observed outbreak behavior in the complex topography western North America. Model predictions are consistent with observed changes in the distribution and frequency of this insect's outbreaks over the past 100 years. These changing patterns are the result of several direct and indirect responses of the insect to temperature. Overwintering survival is negatively affected by warming and determines its southern and lower-elevation limit. Ability to complete its life cycle before killing frosts limits its range to the north and at higher elevations. Interactions affecting synchrony between the insect's feeding life stages and host foliage development also determines fitness and will increase the area favoring fitness of western spruce budworm in the future, especially in western Canada where host trees extend much farther north than the insect currently does.}

  abstract = {SummaryIt has previously been postulated that when plants are stressed by certain changes in patterns of weather they become a better source of food for invertebrate herbivores because this stress causes an increase in the amount of nitrogen available in their tissues for young herbivores feeding on them. And this may cause outbreaks of such phytophagous invertebrates.Evidence is now presented that a similar physiological mechanism appears to operate when a wide variety of apparently unrelated environmental factors impinge on plants or parts of plants in such a way as to perturb their metabolism. A broken branch, lightning strike, fire, nutrient deficiencies or an otherwise adverse site; all may have this effect. With the advent of modern man the available agencies increase and diversify to include pesticides, irradiation and air pollutants.One common metabolic response by plants to all such agents impinging on them seems to be equivalent to that found in senescing plant tissues \textemdash{} the breakdown and mobilization of nitrogen in soluble form away from the senescing/stressed tissues. Young herbivores which chance to feed on such stressed/senescing tissues have a greater and more readily available supply of nitrogen in their food than they would have had if feeding on unstressed plants. As a result many more of them survive, and there is an increase in abundance of their kind. Such increases may be quite localised and short-lived or more widespread and persistent, depending on the extent and duration of the stress experienced by the plants. And in the face of this improved nutrition and survival of the very young, predators and parasites seem to have only a minor influence on subsequent changes in abundance of their herbivorous prey.Another effect of increased mobilization of nitrogen in stressed plants is an increase in the quantity of the seed that they set. This has led to the conclusion that increased abundance of some species of birds at such times is due to a greater supply of seeds as winter food for recent fledglings. But it may be that the increased abundance is due to the synchronous increase in phytophagous insects providing a richer source of protein food for laying hens and growing nestlings.},
